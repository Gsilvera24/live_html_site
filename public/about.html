<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! My name is Gerardo Gomez and I am a motivated Operations Associate in Wealth Management with over 10 years of experience in corporate environments. 
  Recently, I took a Fintech bootcamp where I acquired a broad range of technical skills including Python, SQL, Solidity, and Data Structures.
  As a detail-oriented individual, I take pride in delivering high-quality work and continuously seeking new challenges to develop my skills. 
  I am excited about the prospect of contributing my diverse skillset to a team in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment.

<p>  
  My passion for finance and technology has led me to explore a career transition into a technology role as a Junior Developer or Junior Data Analyst. 
  I am confident that my experience in finance and my technical abilities will enable me to succeed in this field.
